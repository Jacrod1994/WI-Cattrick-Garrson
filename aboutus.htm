<p>Almost a year ago I took the plunge, I had been promising myself for some time that I would join the Women’s Institute, but being a busy wife and a mother I had never got around to it. 
I knew a little about the WI having female relatives and older friends who were members but none that live locally and of course I had seen the film Calendar girls. I’d heard that at the beginning of meetings Jerusalem is sung and I have purchased jams and pickles from country fairs, I can even produce a reasonable Victoria sponge if the mood takes me so I felt I was well qualified for membership. 
I did my homework and found there was a group in Catterick Garrison and so I went along to my first meeting.<p/>

<p>The first thing that that came to my attention was the members were all of a similar age to me, I was made so welcome and that evening’s speaker Alison Grindrod told us all about rose windows. 
I was given a copy of the forecast of speakers for the coming year, something to look forward to. 
The Garrison WI is not a wives club, the only thing that all the members have in common is that they are women, and enjoy the company of other women. 
The 2011 programme has included a tour of the Georgian theatre, a pamper evening, a talk by Lacey’s cheese, a lace making demonstration, a visit to see dancing on ice, a talk by local speaker Heather Ritchie on her life and rag rugs, and we made our own Christmas beaded angels!<p/>

<p>The National Federation of Women’s Institutes, is made up of 69 regional Federations which in turn are made up of the 7,000 WI groups.  
There are about 210,000 members which makes the WI the largest women’s organisation in the UK. Members can be as pro active as they wish; the WI has its own college in Oxfordshire, which has a wide variety of courses for all interests. The WI also campaigns on issues that matter to them and their communities. 
Do you remember “keep Britain Tidy”? That was initiated by the WI, more recently the WI have launched the Love Your Libraries campaign, encouraging communities to love and use their local libraries.<p/>

<p>So, if you are a woman and you fancy spending some time in the company of other likeminded, friendly women why not come to a meeting. 
We meet on the first Wednesday of each month at 7.30pm in the Evergreen room. 
(Behind the AWS buildings on Richmond road) new members are always needed and welcome, but you could just come as a visitor and see what we do, and you don’t need any qualifications!<p/>

<P>Jo Mann WI member Catterick Garrison.<p/>

<p> Time: 7.30pm<p/>
